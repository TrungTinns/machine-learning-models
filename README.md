# Midterm Project: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the midterm project for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at Ton Duc Thang University. The project covers various aspects of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and the critical phenomenon of overfitting. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of different machine learning models, their strengths and limitations, and strategies to mitigate overfitting.

## Abstract

Machine learning is an essential technology that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions. This project delves into various fundamental models such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), linear regression, Naive Bayes classifiers, and decision trees. It also addresses the issue of overfitting, its manifestations, and the methods to prevent it, including regularization techniques, early stopping, and ensemble learning.

## Content Summary

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled datasets to classify data or predict outcomes. This section covers:

- **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value.
- **Classification:** Predicting a categorical value.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns or groupings in unlabeled data. This section includes:

- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points.
- **Association Rule Learning**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. This approach is useful when labeling data is costly or time-consuming.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training models to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding or punishing them based on the outcome.

### Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model is too closely fitted to the training data and performs poorly on new data. This section discusses:

- **Detection:** Identifying overfitting through various techniques.
- **Prevention:** Methods to avoid overfitting, such as:
  - Training with more data
  - Data augmentation
  - Feature selection (pruning)
  - Early stopping
  - Regularization
  - Ensemble methods
